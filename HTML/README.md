# HTML Example

This is the most complex example currently. It is a web page with
a simple CSS stylesheet and some JavaScript.

## Getting Started

Just open index.html in a web browser! Refresh when you make a change.

* Edit "index.html" to change the structure and content of the page.
* Edit "styles.css" to change the appearance of the page.
* Edit "scripts.js" to add code to run when the page loads.
